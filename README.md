Dotfiles!

*You like em, you love em!*

# Useage #

Dotfiles are managed with GNU Stow

Each group of dotfiles should have it's own folder.
For example, .bashrc and .bash_aliases should both go in a directory called bash.
Each directory will be a mirror of the home directory.
For example, within the vim directory there will be a vim/.config directory,
where the vim dotfiles found in ~/.config go.
