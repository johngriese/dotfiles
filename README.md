Dotfiles!

*You like em, you love em!*

So far this includes only a dump of the old files.
Plan now is to added all dotfiles and manage then with Stow.

Each group of dotfiles should have it's own folder.
For example, .bashrc and .bash_aliases should both go in a directory called bash
Each directory will be a mirror of the home directory.
For example, within the vim directory there will be a vim/.config directory,
where the vim dotfiles found in ~/.config go.
